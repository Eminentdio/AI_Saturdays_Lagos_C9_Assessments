overview
on    june     , president bola ahmed tinubu signed the four (  tax reform bills into law. these laws include the nigeria tax act (nta), the nigeria tax administration act (ntaa), the nigeria revenue service act (nrsa and the joint revenue board act (jrba), collectively referred to as “the acts” hereafter). the acts comprehensively overhaul the nigerian tax landscape to drive economic growth, increase revenue generation, improve the business environment and enhance effective tax administration across the different levels of government.
here are some of the changes to know from the tax reform acts:
the nigerian tax reform acts: top    changes to know and top    things to do
increased exemption threshold for small companies - small companies are now exempt from companies income tax (cit), capital gains tax (cgt and the newly introduced development levy (see below). small companies are defined as companies with annual gross turnovers of ngn   million (previously ngn  million and below and total fixed assets not exceeding ngn   million.
increased capital gains tax (cgt rate – the nta increases the capital gains tax rate from    to    for companies. this effectively aligns the cgt and companies income tax rate and reduces any tax arbitrage that could have been unduly enjoyed in the classification between chargeable gains and trading income. for individuals, capital gains will be taxed at the applicable income tax rate based on the progressive tax band of the individual.
cgt on indirect transfer of shares - the nta introduces cgt on indirect transfers of shares in nigerian companies so that where shares are disposed of in intermediary holding companies offshore, a nigeria cgt is triggered (subject to treaty exemptions). also, the tax exemption threshold for the sale of shares in nigerian companies has been increased to ngn   million (from ngn     million in any    consecutive months, provided that the gains do not exceed ngn  million.
introduction of development levy - nigerian companies except small companies will pay a “development levy” at   of their assessable profits (i,e. tax profits before deducting tax depreciation and losses). the development levy consolidates the tertiary education tax (tet), information technology levy (it), the national agency for science and engineering infrastructure (naseni levy and the police trust fund (ptf levy.
minimum effective tax rate (etr - nigerian companies who are members of a multinational group with aggregate group turnover of eur   million and above or have an annual turnover of ngn  billion and above, will now be subject to a minimum effective tax rate (etr of    of their “net income”. net income is defined as profits before tax excluding franked investment income and unrealised gains or losses, except for life insurance companies where the definition of net income also excludes gross and investment income for policyholders. the minimum effective tax rule does not apply to free zone companies on their exports out of nigeria, provided that such companies are not part of multinational groups. the nigerian parent company of a multinational group will have to pay a top up tax where its subsidiaries have paid taxes below the minimum    etr.
a more progressive personal income tax (pit regime - the nta changes the income brackets and applicable tax rates for each bracket. individuals earning ngn   ,    or less per annum will now be exempt from tax on their income and gains, while higher income earners will be taxed at a higher rate up to   %. the act also increases the tax exemption threshold for compensation for loss of employment or injury from ngn  million to ngn  million.
introduction of economic development incentive - the acts replace the “pioneer” tax holiday incentive, with an “economic development incentive” (or edi). this incentive introduces a tax credit of   per annum for   years on qualifying capital expenditure purchased by eligible companies within   years effective from the production date. if a company has unused tax credits or qualifying capital expenses, it can carry them forward for another   years. any credits still unused after this timeline will expire.
resident and non-resident individuals defined - pit will apply to the worldwide income of a resident individual which is now clearly defined in the new act. prior to now there had been varied interpretations due to a lack of proper definition of “residence”. with the definition extending to individuals with substantial economic and immediate family ties in a year of assessment, the law widens the tax net. employment income will now be taxed in nigeria only if the individual is resident in nigeria or performs duties in nigeria without paying tax in their country of residence.
introduction of the tax ombuds office - the acts introduce the tax ombuds office to liaise with the tax authorities on behalf of taxpayers, and serve as an independent arbiter to review and resolve complaints relating to taxes, levies, duties or similar regulatory charges.
vat at zero rate on essential goods and services - the nta expands the list of zero-rated items to include essential goods and services such as basic food items, medical and pharmaceutical products, educational books and materials, electricity generation and transmission services, medical equipment and services, tuition fees, exports (excluding oil and gas exports etc. the impact of this is that businesses selling these goods and services can recover their vat costs, despite the zero rate which was previously not possible by law.
input vat recovery - the vat rate of  .  has been retained. nigeria now adopts globally recognised vat principles that allow for the claim of input vat on all purchases including services and fixed assets. businesses providing services which were previously unable to claim input vat can now do so, provided that the input vat is directly related to their supplies that are also subject to vat.
vat fiscalisation rules - nigeria has now codified vat fiscalisation rules and mandatory e-invoicing for businesses operating in the country. this sets nigeria apart as an early adopter of e-invoicing in africa. companies in nigeria are now mandated to implement the fiscalisation system deployed by the tax authority for the collection of vat.

the nigerian tax reform acts: top    changes to know and top   things to do
read the top    changes and   things to know about the nigerian tax reform acts signed by president bola ahmed tinubu in june     .
top   things to do
in view of the changes introduced by the acts, companies and businesses need to:
become aware
sensitise management – organise sensitisation workshops for relevant board committees and executive management on the impact of the reforms on your business
empower your people- train and upskill staff to ensure seamless adoption of new tax laws in specific roles and processes that are impacted.
carry out a holistic impact analysis - proactively assess the corporate structure, operational, financial and compliance implications arising from the tax laws. this can also include considering the impact on supply chains, commercial arrangements such as acquisitions and divestments, incentive regimes and so on.
articulate
reframe tax strategy- reframe your tax strategy to align with the commercial goals of the business. more will be expected from the tax function to protect business value amidst the various changes arising from the new laws or technology changes such as the vat fiscalisation.
set up a tax risk register- implement a living risk register to continuously identify, monitor, and control tax risks and opportunities that have been triggered by the reforms in real time.
operationalise and implement
update compliance processes- taxpayers will need to update their compliance processes in line with the tax laws. for example, taxpayers will need to update their systems to cater for new rates, revised compliance obligations and filing requirements, information sharing, claim of input vat etc.
execute your implementation plan- achieve tasks in your implementation plan effectively and efficiently in line with your strategic objectives.
leverage technology- update the logic in accounting software and erp to align with the new rules. ensure processes and technology align to ensure end-to-end compliance and prepare for changes such as e-invoicing.
optimise tax governance management frameworks- evaluate, expand, or eliminate tax functions and processes for effectiveness and efficiency, closing compliance gaps and embedding robust internal controls.
engage stakeholders -determine a communication strategy and protocol for key internal and external stakeholders. some examples include: shareholders – roi impact, employees – paye impact, customers – e-invoicing processes, vendors – kyc and validation, tax authorities – rulings on new risks, host communities etc to ensure a smooth transition and adoption process.
monitor
stay updated- regularly monitor official communications, information circulars or regulations from the government authorities issued pursuant to the tax laws.
manage change - apart from training and upskilling, there should be a deliberate change management plan to drive behaviour, review and monitor the transition and adoption of the new rules.
conclusion
the recent enactment of the acts marks a significant transformation in nigeria’s tax landscape. it is crucial for businesses to carry out a comprehensive review of their tax strategies, processes, and compliance frameworks to ensure readiness and resilience.
pwc has developed a robust sector-by-sector analysis of these changes, which will provide more insights and guidance to help businesses understand and respond to the evolving tax environment.
